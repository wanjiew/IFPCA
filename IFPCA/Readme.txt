IF-PCA

This archive contains a Matlab implementation of IF-PCA algorithm as described in the paper 
J. Jin and W. Wang (2014) Important Features PCA for High Dimensional Clustering


Current version 

V1.1


SHORT DOCUMENTATION

For more information, type help functionname in the Matlab command line.

Usage:	
	 [label, stats, numselect] = ifpca(Data, K, KSvalue, pvalcut, rep, kmeansrep, per);


Inputs: 
	Data: p by n data matrix where p is the number of features and n is the number of samples. Each column presents the observations for a sample. 
	K: number of clusters

Inputs (Optional):
	KSvalue: simulated Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics
	pvalcut: the threshold to elminate the effect of features as outliers, default is log(p)/p.
	rep: the number of Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics to be simulated in the algorithm, defacult 100*p.
	kmeansrep: repetitions in kmeans algorithm for the last step of IF-PCA, defacult to be 30. 
	per: a number with 0 < per <= 1, the percentage of Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics that will be used in the normalization step, default to be 1. When the data is highly skewed, this parameter can be specified, such as 0.5.

Output: 
	label: n by 1 vector, as the estimated labels for each sample
	stats: 4 by 1 struct, including the important statistics in the algorithm as following:
	  stats.KS: p by 1 vector shows normalized KS value for each feature;
	  stats.HC: p by 1 vector shows the HC value for each feature;
	  stats.pval: p by 1 vector shows the p-value for each feature;
 	  stats.ranking: p by 1 vector shows the ranking for each feature according to ranking with p-values
	numselect: number of selected features in IF-PCA
